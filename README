The flosslogic project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source (floss) logic analyzer software that supports various
(usually USB-based) logic analyzer hardware products.

There will be a shared library with common code, a command line utility for
basic usage and easy scriptability, as well as an intuitive GUI.

Additionally a custom Open-Hardware logic analyzer hardware may be created
at some point.


Status and API
--------------

The flosslogic project is currently work in progress.

IMPORTANT: The API of the library is NOT yet considered stable! Please do
           not rely on it, yet! Changes to function names, macro names etc.
           can happen at any time without prior notice!
