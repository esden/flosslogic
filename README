The flosslogic project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source (floss) logic analyzer software that supports various
(usually USB-based) logic analyzer hardware products.

There will be a shared library with common code, a command line utility for
basic usage and easy scriptability, as well as an intuitive GUI.

Additionally a custom Open-Hardware logic analyzer hardware may be created
at some point.
